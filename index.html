      <h2>Budan Uncle Café</h2>
      <p>
        That café didn’t know it was special.  
        It was just another ordinary place, another ordinary day.
        <br><br>
        We saw each other. No conversation. No curiosity.
        We ignored that moment completely.
        <br><br>
        But destiny didn’t.

      <h2>23 January 2023</h2>
      <p>
        When we started dating, it wasn’t serious.
        No pressure. No plans.
        <br><br>
        Just comfort, laughter, and ease.
        <br><br>
        We didn’t know then that this comfort would slowly turn into commitment.

      <h2>Growing Together</h2>
      <p>
        Somewhere between conversations and support, something shifted.
        <br><br>
        Together, we became serious about life.
        About dreams. About the future.
        <br><br>
        “Someday” finally had a direction — and it was us.

      <h2>14 March 2024</h2>
      <p>
        Seeing you for the first time felt unreal.
        <br><br>
        Like a fairytale I had imagined too many times —
        and suddenly it was real.
        <br><br>
        That moment didn’t just make me happy.
        It made me sure.

      <h2>5 April 2025</h2>
      <p>
        After one whole year, we met again.
        <br><br>
        This time it wasn’t just us.
        Our families came closer so naturally, so sweetly.
        <br><br>
        It felt right. It felt permanent.

        Always you. Always us. Always home. 🤍
